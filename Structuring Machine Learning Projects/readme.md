## **Structuring Machine Learning Projects** ##

### Key Concepts ###

**Week 1**
- Understand why Machine Learning strategy is important
- Apply satisficing and optimizing metrics to set up your goal for ML projects
- Choose a correct train/dev/test split of your dataset
- Understand how to define human-level performance
- Use human-level perform to define your key priorities in ML projects
- Take the correct ML Strategic decision based on observations of performances and dataset

**Week 2**
- Understand what multi-task learning and transfer learning are
- Recognize bias, variance and data-mismatch by looking at the performances of your algorithm on train/dev/test sets
